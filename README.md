Question 1:
You have a log file named access.log containing HTTP request data, with each line in the
following format:
127.0.0.1 - - [08/Aug/2024:14:55:02 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1043
Task: Write a bash script to extract all lines from access.log where the request method is POST
and the HTTP status code is 404.


Question 2:
Power_levels.txt contains :
101,Goku,DBZ,88000
102,Saitama,One Punch Man,83000
103,Gojo,JJK,57000
104,Luffy,One Piece,64000
105,Ichigo,Bleach,43000

Each line represents how much work a senior (disguised as anime characters) has completed.
To gauge whether your group has any hope of surviving this first onslaught of IIIT Hyderabad's
legendary workload, you need to sum up these "power levels" and see if you can make it
through with your sanity (and social life) intact.
Your task: Write a bash script to calculate the total power level of all the seniors in
power_levels.txt. A single-liner command is very much possible.
Expected Output: 335000
